# Troubleshooting odscex

This guide is intended for tenant administrators who operate `odscex` in scheduled jobs, broad group assignments, migration projects, or service-principal based automation.

Start with a preflight check whenever possible:

```powershell
$PermissionCheckParameters = @{
    Uri = 'https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/WorkingSite'
    DocumentLibrary = 'Documents'
    UserPrincipalName = 'user@contoso.com'
    GroupId = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'
}

Test-odscexPermission @PermissionCheckParameters | Format-Table -AutoSize
```

`Test-odscexPermission` validates the Graph connection, optional group membership access, optional user OneDrive access, optional SharePoint site access, and optional shortcut target resolution. Run it before a large `Invoke-odscexShortcutAssignment` or `Invoke-odscexApply` job.

## Quick triage checklist

1. Confirm the current automation has called `Connect-odscex` and that the app registration has admin-consented Microsoft Graph application permissions.
2. Run `Test-odscexPermission` with the same user, group, site, document library, and folder inputs that the failing job uses.
3. Re-run the failing command with `-Verbose` to capture the Graph resource path, retry messages, and request id when available.
4. For organization-scale changes, run the command with `-WhatIf` first and write a report with `-ReportPath`.
5. If only some users fail, separate target resolution failures from user OneDrive provisioning or per-user permission issues.

## Authentication and token issues

### Symptom: `Please run Connect-odscex first.`

The module did not find a usable Microsoft Graph token. Call `Connect-odscex` in the same PowerShell session or runspace as the failing command.

```powershell
$ClientSecretParameters = @{
    String = $env:ODSCEX_CLIENT_SECRET
    AsPlainText = $true
    Force = $true
}

$ConnectParameters = @{
    TenantId = $env:ODSCEX_TENANT_ID
    ClientId = $env:ODSCEX_CLIENT_ID
    ClientSecret = ConvertTo-SecureString @ClientSecretParameters
}

Connect-odscex @ConnectParameters
```

For scheduled jobs and CI systems, make sure each run authenticates before calling any other `odscex` command. Tokens are stored in module session state, not in a machine-wide cache.

### Symptom: token request fails for a cloud

Check that the selected cloud and endpoint match your tenant:

```powershell
$ConnectParameters = @{
    TenantId = $env:ODSCEX_TENANT_ID
    ClientId = $env:ODSCEX_CLIENT_ID
    ClientSecret = ConvertTo-SecureString -String $env:ODSCEX_CLIENT_SECRET -AsPlainText -Force
}

Connect-odscex -Cloud Global @ConnectParameters
```

Change `-Cloud` to `GCC`, `GCCHigh`, `DoD`, or `China` only when the tenant is hosted in that Microsoft cloud. Use `-GraphEndpoint` only when you intentionally need a custom Graph root. If you provide both `-Cloud` and legacy `-AzureCloudInstance`, they must describe the same cloud.

## Microsoft Graph permission failures

### Symptom: Graph returns `403` for basic calls

A `403` generally means the app registration can authenticate but lacks the application permission needed for the resource. Confirm admin consent for the permissions required by your scenario.

Common permission areas:

| Scenario | Typical permissions to validate |
| --- | --- |
| Read organization and users | `User.Read.All` or a broader directory read permission |
| Read group transitive members | `GroupMember.Read.All`, `Group.Read.All`, or `Directory.Read.All` |
| Read hidden group membership | `Member.Read.Hidden` in addition to group membership permissions |
| Resolve SharePoint sites and lists | `Sites.Read.All` / `Sites.ReadWrite.All`, or suitable site-scoped access |
| Create, move, rename, or remove shortcuts in OneDrive | `Files.ReadWrite.All` and/or site/file permissions appropriate for your tenant model |

After updating permissions, grant admin consent and acquire a new token by running `Disconnect-odscex` and `Connect-odscex` again.

### Symptom: group targeting fails with a message about `transitiveMembers`

Group targeting calls Microsoft Graph transitive member APIs. Grant admin consent for `GroupMember.Read.All`, or use a broader equivalent such as `Group.Read.All` or `Directory.Read.All`. Hidden membership groups also require `Member.Read.Hidden`.

If permissions are intentionally restricted, export the target users to CSV from an approved source and use `Get-odscexTargetUser -CsvPath` instead of direct group targeting.

## User OneDrive access and provisioning

### Symptom: only certain users fail during assignment

Validate an affected user directly:

```powershell
$CheckParameters = @{
    UserPrincipalName = 'user@contoso.com'
}

Test-odscexPermission @CheckParameters
Get-odscexDrive @CheckParameters
```

Common causes:

* The user's OneDrive has not been provisioned yet.
* The account is disabled or unlicensed.
* The app registration cannot access that user's drive under the tenant's current permission or conditional-access model.
* The input user is malformed, duplicated, or uses an external/guest identity that does not have a OneDrive drive.

For CSV targeting, verify that the file contains `UserPrincipalName`, `UserObjectId`, or `Id` columns and that each row resolves to the expected user.

## SharePoint site and document library resolution

### Symptom: site cannot be resolved

Use the exact SharePoint site URL, not a sharing link or a document-library URL with extra path segments:

```powershell
Test-odscexPermission -Uri 'https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/WorkingSite'
```

If the tenant uses a national cloud, confirm the SharePoint URL and the Graph cloud selected in `Connect-odscex` belong to the same environment.

### Symptom: document library name is not found

`-DocumentLibrary` is matched against SharePoint list display names. Confirm the display name in SharePoint or use the stable list id instead:

```powershell
New-odscex `
    -Uri 'https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/WorkingSite' `
    -DocumentLibraryId '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000' `
    -UserPrincipalName 'user@contoso.com'
```

Use `-DocumentLibraryId` when display names are localized, duplicated, renamed, or ambiguous.

### Symptom: document library name matches multiple libraries

Specify `-DocumentLibraryId` for deterministic behavior. If you intentionally want the first match, use `-AllowAmbiguousLibraryMatch`, but prefer the list id for automation.

### Symptom: selected target is a SharePoint list, not a document library

Choose a document library, not a generic SharePoint list. If using `-DocumentLibraryId`, verify the id belongs to a list whose template is `documentLibrary`.

## Folder and path issues

### Symptom: `-FolderPath` cannot be found

`-FolderPath` is relative to the root of the selected document library. Do not include the library name in the path.

```powershell
# Correct when the library is Documents and the target is Documents/Projects/2026
-FolderPath 'Projects/2026'

# Incorrect
-FolderPath 'Documents/Projects/2026'
```

Confirm the folder exists and that the app registration can read it.

### Symptom: `-RelativePath` cannot be found or shortcut creation fails in a OneDrive subfolder

`-RelativePath` is relative to the user's OneDrive root and controls where the shortcut appears in the user's OneDrive. For desired-state operations, odscex can create missing OneDrive folders when the operation path supports it, but admins should still validate the target path on a small pilot group before a broad rollout.

Avoid leading slashes and prefer forward slashes:

```powershell
-RelativePath 'Shortcuts/Department Sites'
```

If Graph rejects direct shortcut creation in a nested OneDrive folder, odscex retries fallback creation and move operations for supported cases. Run with `-Verbose` to see retry behavior.

## Existing shortcut conflicts

### Symptom: shortcut already exists or has the wrong target

Use `Set-odscexShortcutState` for idempotent convergence instead of only `New-odscex`. Pick a conflict action that matches your change policy:

| Conflict action | Use when |
| --- | --- |
| `Skip` | Existing shortcuts should be left untouched. |
| `Replace` | A wrong shortcut should be removed and recreated. |
| `Rename` | A new shortcut should be created with a unique name when a conflict exists. |
| `Error` | Any unexpected existing shortcut should fail the run. |

Start with `-WhatIf` when changing conflict behavior across many users.

## Throttling, transient failures, and request ids

### Symptom: Graph returns `429`, `500`, `502`, `503`, or `504`

The module retries transient Microsoft Graph failures with exponential backoff and honors `Retry-After` when Graph provides it. For large assignments:

* Use smaller target batches.
* Schedule jobs outside peak business hours.
* Keep `-Verbose` output from failed runs so you can inspect status codes and request ids.
* Re-run failed users from the report instead of reprocessing every user.

If failures persist with the same request id or resource path, open a Microsoft support case with the request id, timestamp, tenant id, and failing Graph resource.

## Reporting and audit output

For broad changes, always write a report:

```powershell
Invoke-odscexShortcutAssignment @AssignmentParameters -ReportPath '.\odscex-results.csv' -ReportFormat Csv
```

Recommended workflow:

1. Run with `-WhatIf` for a small pilot group.
2. Run without `-WhatIf` for the pilot and review the report.
3. Expand to a larger group.
4. Re-run only failed rows after correcting permissions, paths, or provisioning issues.

Use CSV for operational triage, JSON for automation pipelines, and CLIXML when you need PowerShell-native object fidelity.

## National cloud endpoint checks

Use the `-Cloud` parameter instead of manually setting endpoints unless you have a specific advanced scenario.

| Cloud | Graph endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| `Global` | `https://graph.microsoft.com` |
| `GCC` | `https://graph.microsoft.com` |
| `GCCHigh` | `https://graph.microsoft.us` |
| `DoD` | `https://dod-graph.microsoft.us` |
| `China` | `https://microsoftgraph.chinacloudapi.cn` |

If authentication succeeds but all resource calls fail, verify:

* The tenant belongs to the selected cloud.
* The SharePoint site URL belongs to that same cloud.
* The app registration exists and has consent in that tenant/cloud.
* Any custom `-GraphEndpoint` starts with `https://` and points to the intended Graph root.

## Escalation checklist

When escalating to a platform owner or Microsoft support, capture:

* The exact command and sanitized parameters.
* `-Verbose` output.
* The failing user, group id, site URL, document library name/id, and folder path.
* The HTTP status code and Graph request id if present.
* The output of `Test-odscexPermission` for the same inputs.
* Whether the issue affects all users or only a subset.
